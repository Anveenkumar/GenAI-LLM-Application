This repository contains a simple application utilizing a pre-existing GenAI Large Language Model (LLM) to demonstrate its capabilities.

## Assignment Details
- [Assignment: Custom GenAI LLM Application
Create a simple application utilizing a pre-existing GenAI Large Language Model (LLM)
to demonstrate its capabilities.
The goal is to build a functional, interactive application that leverages the model for a
specific task. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach can be used using
pre-built RAG frameworks or libraries to simplify integration.
Requirements:
1. Model Selection: Choose a pre-trained GenAI LLM model from available
sources (e.g., OpenAI's GPT models, Hugging Face Transformers, etc.)
2. Application Functionality: Develop a basic application that integrates with the
chosen model.
3. Documentation:
○ Provide a brief README file explaining the purpose of the application,
how to set it up, and how to use it.

4. Repository Hosting:
○ Create a public GitHub repository for the project.]
